### Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cup dried green (French) lentils, rinsed and picked through
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, plus more to taste
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 bunch green onions, sliced
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 4 cups fresh cherries (about 1 pound), pitted and halved
- 1 cup chopped fresh basil

### Directions
Combine lentils and 5 cups water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower heat and simmer, partially covered, until just tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool slightly.

In a large bowl, combine vinegar, oil, green onions, salt and pepper. Add warm lentils and toss until coated. Let cool to room temperature; refrigerate if not serving immediately. Toss with cherries and basil just before serving. Taste and then add more salt or more vinegar if you like.
