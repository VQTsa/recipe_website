### Ingredients
##### Marinated Kale:
- 8 cups (packed) kale leaves (Note 1)
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper

##### Quinoa:
- 1 cup quinoa, any colour
- 2 cups water

##### Dressing:
- Zest of 1 large lemon
- 2 1/2 tbsp lemon juice
- 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard (or American)
- 1 garlic clove , minced
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, I add it)
- 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper

##### Salad:
- 1/4 cup dill leaves , roughly chopped
- 1/4 cup coriander/cilantro leaves , roughly chopped
- 1 red onion , quartered and finely sliced (optional)
- 1/3 - 1/2 cup chopped roasted almonds
- 100 g crumbled feta



### Directions
##### Marinated Kale:
1. Scrunch up the kale leaves then slice to about 1cm thickness.
2. Transfer to large bowl.
3. Drizzle over oil, scatter with salt and pepper. Use your hands to scrunch the kale leaves for 1 minute ([see video](https://youtu.be/RZF2Z3ZOJhI?t=31)). It should shrink to about half the size.
4. Set aside for 30 minutes. The leaves will soften, making them suitable for eating raw.

##### Quinoa:
1. Place quinoa in a fine mesh colander, then rinse under running water for 30 seconds. Drain excess water well. (Or do this in a big bowl)
2. Place in a saucepan with water. Cover with lid, bring to simmer over medium heat then leave for 12 - 15 minutes until all water is absorbed.
3. Remove from heat, leave lid on, and rest for 5 - 10 minutes. Fluff with fork then cool (spread on tray and refrigerate to speed up).

##### Dressing:
1. Place ingredients in a jar, screw lid on and shake well. Set aside for 10 minutes.

##### Salad:
1. Add the quinoa into the bowl with the kale. Add all the dill and coriander/cilantro, half the nuts, feta, and 2/3 of dressing.
2. Toss well.
3. Transfer into serving platter or bowls. Drizzle with remaining dressing, garnish with remaining feta and nuts. 
4. See Note 3 for serving suggestions - I've been having this as a meal, just plain.
