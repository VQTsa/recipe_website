### All butter cornmeal crust:
- 150 gr all-purpose flour
- 100 gr fine cornmeal flour
- 125 sweet butter, torn into small pieces
- a pinch of salt
- 1 egg for egg wash

Mix all the ingredients except the egg together, roll out, and place in a deep dish pie pan or terra cotta gratin pan like I use.  Make a fluted edge high enough to hold the filling. Brush with egg wash and let dry while preparing the filling

### Sweet Potato and Quince FIlling
- sweet potatoes - two-3 very large potatoes- about  1.5 kilo or 3 lbs. Roasted until soft and peel removed
- 1 or 2 quince, apple, or pear. Roasted until soft and cored and peeled
- 1 can evaporated milk
- 2-3 eggs
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon of “The Secret” flavoring* or good vanilla extract

Mix all of the ingredients together and whisk or blend together until smooth.
Pour into pastry crust and bake in an moderate oven at 350’ for 45-55 min until the filling is set and barely jiggly. Let cool or refrigerate overnight, serve with whipped cream, ice cream, or crème fraîche. Enjoy and give thanks!

*Steep some vanilla beans in armagnac, add some rum, and orange flower water. Let sleep together for awhile. Eh Voila- Le Secret!
