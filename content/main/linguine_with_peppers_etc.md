### Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 20 medium shrimp (1/2 lb.), raw, peeled and deveined
- 2 thin slices prosciutto cut into thin strips
- 1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips
- ¾ tsp. salt divided plus more for pasta water
- ¾ tsp. ground black pepper, divided
- 4 garlic cloves thinly sliced
- 10 green pitted olives, thickly
- 1 cup (4 large) canned artichoke hearts, cut into thin wedges
- 1/3 cup dry white wine such as Pinot Grigio
- 2 tsp. chopped thyme
- 10 ounces linguine
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter

### Directions
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  In a large deep skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Add shrimp and cook over medium heat without stirring, until halfway cooked and pink on bottom, about 1 minute. Turn shrimp, then scatter prosciutto over top; cook until shrimp are barely done; about 30 minutes.  Put shrimp and prosciutto in a medium bowl and set aside. Add remaining oil to skillet.  Add red pepper strips along with ¼ tsp. each of salt and pepper and cook over medium heat, stirring a few times until softened, about 5minutes.  Add garlic and cook about 2 minutes. Add olives, artichokes, wine and thyme and remove from heat.
2. Salt the boiling water; add linguine, and cook until al dente, about 9 minutes.  Reserve ½ cup pasta water. Drain linguine and add to skillet. Add reserved shrimp, prosciutto, and any accumulated juices to skillet and cook over medium high heat about 1 minute, stirring in reserved pasta water 2 tablespoon at a time. Remove from heat; season with remaining salt and pepper, and stir in butter.  Divide among 4 past bowls and serve.
