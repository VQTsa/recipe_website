### Ingredients
- 1	big bunch of kale, rinsed, ribs removed and torn into large pieces
- 3/4	cup EVOO, 2 tablespoons of which was Meyer lemon olive oil
- 1/2	cup Parmigiano, microplaned
- 2	cloves garlic, smashed and rough chopped
- 1/2	cup pine nuts
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1	tablespoon lemon juice, fresh

### Directions
1. Blanch the kale in boiling salted water for about 3 minutes and chill down in a cold water bath, drain and squeeze excess water. Place into small work bowl of food processor and pulse to start breaking up the kale, add rough chopped garlic, process, add pine nuts, pulse several times. Slowly add the olive oils and lemon juice, process until everything is broken down. It will never be real smooth. Finally add the cheese and pulse a few times. Season with salt and pepper. If serving with pasta grate a little extra cheese over and add EVOO to the hot pasta, toss with pesto, serve with additional grated cheese.

2. These are the basics of my recipe and the way that I prefer it, but you can add more garlic, lemon, or oil if you like.

Makes about 1- 1 1/2 cups
