### Ingredients
Cookies
- 175 mL sugar
- 250 mL butter softened
- 1 package (85 grams) cream cheese, softened
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon peppermint extract
- 710 mL all purpose flower

Glaze
- 250 mL semi-sweet real chocolate chips
- 60 mL butter


### Directions
1. For cookies, in a large mixer bowl combine sugar, butter, cream cheese, egg and peppermint extract. Beat at medium speed, scraping bowl often, until light and fluffy. Add flour; beat until mixed. Divide dough in halves. Wrap in waxed paper. Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours.

2. Pre-heat oven to 190 deg C. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 6mm thickness. Cut out with floured heart-shaped cutters. Place 2.5cm apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until edges are very lightly browned. Remove immediately; cool completely on wire racks.

3. For glaze, in small saucepan, melt chocolate and butter, stirring occasionally,
over low heat until melted, 4 to 6 minutes. Dip half of each heart into chocolate. Refrigerate on waxed paper-lined cookie sheet until chocolate is firm. Store, covered in refrigerator.
